### Description ###
This is small project for downloading whole Vbox7 channels. It is written in Node.js and uses Selenium and Puppeteer for scraping the data.

### Pre-requisites ###
1. Node.js installed (required version 18.0.0 or higher)

### Installation ###
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project (root) directory
2. Run `npm install` command in the terminal to install all dependencies
3. Rename `.env_example` to `.env` and fill the variables with your data

### Usage ###
1. Run `npm run vbox` command in the terminal to start scraping

### Alternatives ###
If you can't use the bot for some reason you can use one of the following alternatives for downloading the videos directly from the browser:
1. [Download videos from new vbox7 servers] (https://youtube4kdownloader.com/)  
2. [Download videos from old vbox7 server] (https://downloader.tube/download-vbox7-video/)  
Remember that Vbox7 has two way for distributting the videos (downloading from old server or downloading from new servers). If the first method doesn't work try the second one and vice versa.
